### Sr. Analyst, Data systems and Automation

## Projects

### Idea Management
A web platform to manage campaigns/Hackathons where users submit ideas and votes peer ideas.  

Angular | Python  
GraphQL APIs  
AWS Amplify | AWS Appsync | AWS S3 | AWS DynamoDB | AWS Cognito | AWS Lambda | AWS API Gateway

One of a kind serverless web application with mostly no backend code because of Appsync and GraphQL APIs included in the design. Users can share any type of file(documents, videos, photos, etc.,) to support their submission.  

Upside of this architecture:
- Significant reduction in infrastructure cost and operations cost.
- Ease of maintainence.
- Rapid prototyping and roll out of new features.
- More time to enhance UI/UX since minimal effort needed on backend for services with CRUD operations.

Downside of this architecture:
- Vendor lockin

### Defect Classification
An ecosystem to train, classify and analyze images and predict if it has a defect from production floor in real time. A reactive and event driven application.  

Angular | Python | Flask  
REST APIs  
Google AutoML | Google Appengine | Google cloud storage | Google Cloud Functions | Google BigQuery | Google Firestore | Firebase Authentication | Firebase Cloud Messaging | Google Cloud Tasks | Firebase Hosting

- Using AutoML to train machine learning model and predict whether an image has any defects in real time with cloud storage and cloud functions. 
- Appenigne REST APIs and Angular PWA(Progressive Web App) with Material Design UI/UX for users to interact with the data.
- APIs to interact and take advantage of BigQuery from the web app.

### Enterprise Notifications
A platform with web and mobile apps to send and receive notifications in real time at scale.

Angular | Nativescript(for mobile app) | Java | Spring  
REST APIs  
Google Appengine | Google Cloud Functions | Google Cloud Tasks | Google Cloud Datastore | Firebase Authentication | Firebase Cloud Messaging | Firebase Hosting  

- APIs to send messages and push notifications to an user or a group of users.
- Nativescript Mobile(Android and iOS) and Angular PWA apps to manage messages and groups for users.
- Message can be sent from any machine or server or from the web portal.

### Enterprise Approval
A mobile app enabling users to securely approve many types of business approvals.

Nativescript | Java | Spring  
REST APIs  
Google Appengine | Google Cloud Tasks | Google Cloud Datastore | Firebase Authentication | Firebase Cloud Messaging  

### eBook
An Angular PWA  - organized library for content such as documents and videos.

Angular | Java | Spring  
REST APIs  
Google Appengine | Google Cloud Storage | Google Cloud Firestore | Firebase Authentication  

### Events
An event scheduler app like the Google I/O app, but in this app, user can manage multiple events and schedules.

Angular | Python | Flask  
REST APIs  
Google Cloud Functions | Google Cloud Firestore

## POCs
Docker | MongoDB | AWS Fargate | Google Cloud Run | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn
