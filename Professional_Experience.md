### Idea Management
A web platform to manage campaigns/Hackathons where users submit ideas and votes peer ideas.  
JAN 2020 - Present  

Angular | Python  
GraphQL APIs  
AWS Amplify | AWS Appsync | AWS S3 | AWS DynamoDB | AWS Cognito | AWS Lambda | AWS API Gateway

One of a kind serverless web application with mostly no backend code because of Appsync and GraphQL APIs included in the design.  

Upside of this architecture:
- Significant reduction in infrastructure cost and operations cost.
- Ease of maintainence.
- Rapid prototyping and roll out of new features.
- More time to enhance UI/UX since minimal effort needed on backend for services with CRUD operations.

Downside of this architecture:
- Vendor lockin

### Defect Classification
An ecosystem to train, classify and analyze defect in images from production floor in real time. A reactive and event driven application.
JAN 2019 - DEC 2020

Angular | Python | Flask  
REST APIs 
Google AutoML | Google Appengine | Google cloud storage | Google Cloud Functions | Google BigQuery | Google Firestore | Firebase Authentication | Firebase Cloud Messaging | Google Cloud Tasks | Firebase Hosting

- Using AutoML to train machine learning model and predict whether an image has any defects in real time with cloud storage and cloud functions. 
- Appenigne REST APIs and Angular PWA(Progressive Web App) with Material Design UI/UX for users to interact with the data.
- APIs to interact and take advantage of BigQuery from the web app.
